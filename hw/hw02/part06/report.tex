    \section{Background}
    Create a test bench to demonstrate the functionality of the following code in which a and b are 1-bit inputs. Note this example as provided breaks certain coding rules. The test bench should produce a table using the \textbf{\$strobe} task. Your calls should print time using \textbf{\%0t} and \textbf{\$time}. Provide your test bench and the output. Use the output to produce a condensed table with comments explaining the operation of the circuit.

    \section{Implementation}
    The provided code was directly used to implement the module in Part 6, and can be found in the `scripts' directory. A sample of the waveform generated is provided:

    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{wav.png}
            \caption{Waveform Generated from Part 6 Test Bench} \label{fig:wav}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    The following table is generated from the test bench as well, demonstrating the usage of the circuit:

    \begin{table}[h]

        \caption{Inputs and Outputs of The Part 6 Test Bench}
        \centering
        \begin{tabular*}{200pt}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}} ccccc}

            \textbf{time} & \textbf{a} & \textbf{b} & \textbf{y} & \textbf{z} \\
            \hline
             3000 & 0 & 0 & 00 & xx \\
            10000 & 0 & 1 & 00 & 10 \\
            17000 & 1 & 0 & 1x & 01 \\
            24000 & 0 & 0 & 00 & 01 \\
            26000 & 0 & 0 & 00 & 01 \\
            33000 & 0 & 1 & 00 & 10 \\
            40000 & 1 & 0 & 1x & 01 \\
            47000 & 1 & 1 & 1x & 01 \\
        \end{tabular*}
    \end{table}

    \section{Observations}
    The module appears to simulate a variation of a multi-bit multiplexer, although with poor implementation. The cases in the behavior do not cover all conditions, and therefore outputs are uncertain depending on certain combinations of the inputs.
