        \item[\textbf{3.6}]
        \begin{itemize}

            \item[\textbf{5}] Show that no proper subgroup of $S_4$ contains
            both $(1, 2, 3, 4)$ and $(1, 2)$.
            \begin{proof}
            \end{proof}

            \item[\textbf{9}] A rigid motion of a cube can be thought of either
            as a permutation of its eight vertices or as a permutation of its
            six sides. Find a rigid motion of the cube that has order 3, and
            express the permutation that represents it in both ways, as a
            permutation on eight elements and as a permutation on six elements.
            \begin{proof}
            \end{proof}

            \item[\textbf{10}] Show that the following matrices form a subgroup
            of $GL_2(C)$ isomorphic to $D_4$:
            \begin{equation*}
                \pm\left[\begin{tabular}{cc}
                            1 & 0 \\
                            0 & 1
                \end{tabular}\right],

                            0 & -i

            \textit{Hint:} Consider two cases, depending on whether $n$ is odd
            or even.
            \begin{proof}
            \end{proof}

            \item[\textbf{24}] Show that the product of two transpositions is
            one of (i) the identity; (ii) a 3-cycle; (iii) a product of two
            (nondisjoint) 3-cycles. Deduce that every element of $A_n$ can be
            written as a product of 3-cycles.
