\section{Part 2}
    \subsection{Question}
    A random sample of 12 graduates of a secretarial school averaged 73.2 words per minute with a standard deviation of 7.9 words per minute on a typing test. What can we conclude, at the 0.05 level, regarding the claim that secretaries at this school average less than 75 words per minute on the typing test?

    \subsection{Answer}
    The null hypothesis, $H_{0}$, claims the mean depth of the ocean in a certain area is 72.4, while the alternative hypothesis, $H_{a}$, says otherwise.

        \[ H_{0}: \mu = 72.4 \ vs \ H_{a}: \mu \neq 73.2 \]

    Calculating the Z-score:

        \[ Z = \frac{X-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{73.2-72.4}{\frac{2.1}{\sqrt{35}}} \]


    The following snippet was used to generate the Z-value and its probability:
\begin{lstlisting}
    X <- 73.2
    mu <- 72.4
    sigma <- 2.1
    n <- 35

    z <- (X - mu)/(sigma/sqrt(n))
    print(z)  # print the Z-score
    print(pnorm(z))  # print the probability
\end{lstlisting}

    The Z-score was computed to be:

        \[ Z=2.2537, \ P(Z) =0.9879 \]
