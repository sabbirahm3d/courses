# Fall 2017 Term Project

## Overview
The objective of the project is to experience the design issues of advanced computer architectures through the design of a simulator for a simplified MIPS computer using high level programming languages. The specification requirements for the project are detailed in the prompt.

## Simulator
The project is implemented in Python in an object-oriented design. External scripts have been attached for testing and debugging purposes.

### Usage
The helper script `make.sh` may be used to execute the simulation with the required file inputs. Running the following command will execute the simulation: ```./make.sh```

### Requirements
- Python 2.7
