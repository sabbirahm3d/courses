\subsection{Output}

    The first sample mean and standard deviation were computed:

    \[ E(\overline{X}) = 1.000, \ \sigma_{\overline{X}} = 0.926 \]

    All the samples were then used to find the sample mean and standard
    deviation. The theoretical values were also computed based on the
    relationships:

    \[ \mu = np \]
    \[ E(\overline{X}) = np \]
    \[ \sigma = np(1-p) \]
    \[ \sigma_{\overline{X}} = \frac{np(1-p)}{\sqrt{n}} \]
