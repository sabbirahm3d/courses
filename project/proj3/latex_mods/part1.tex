\section{Part 1}
    \subsection{Question}
    An oceanographer wants to test, on the basis of a random sample of size 35, whether the average depth of the ocean in a certain area is 72.4 fathoms. At the 0.05 level of significance, what will the oceanographer decide if she gets a sample mean of 73.2? Assume the population standard deviation is 2.1.

    \subsection{Answer}
    The null hypothesis, $H_{0}$, claims the mean depth of the ocean in a certain area is 72.4, while the alternative hypothesis, $H_{a}$, says otherwise.

        \[ H_{0}: \mu = 72.4 \ vs \ H_{a}: \mu \neq 72.4 \]

    Since the population mean and standard deviation was known with a sample size of $n > 30$, the Z-score was calculated as follows:

        \input{latex_mods/part1_out.tex}

    The following snippet was used to generate the Z-value and its probability:
\begin{lstlisting}
    X <- 73.2
    mu <- 72.4
    sigma <- 2.1
    n <- 35

    z <- (X - mu)/(sigma/sqrt(n))
    print(z)  # print the Z-score
    print(pnorm(z))  # print the probability
\end{lstlisting}

    The Z-score was computed to be:

        \[ Z=2.2537, \ P(Z) =0.9879 \]
