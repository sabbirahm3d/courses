    \section{Background} In this project students will learn to use generated
    IP Cores: a block RAM and a CORDIC processor for calculating square root.
    An essential skill to develop is the coding of a control finite state
    machine (FSM) to interface modules.

    Figure \ref{fig:datapath} provides the datapath of the interface. Students
    must identify the status and control signals and create a state machine to
    control them.

        \subsection{Requirements}

        \begin{itemize}

        \item The design should access 4 bytes from the serial port to initiate
        action

        \item The implementation should assume 4 bytes will be sent: ADDRESS-
        HIGH, ADDRESS-LOW, DATA-HIGH, DATA-LOW

        \item After 4 bytes are received the design should

        \begin{itemize}

            \item Read the contents of the RAM and send the HIGH-BYTE, then
            LOW-BYTE back through the UART

            \item Send the data bytes through the CORDIC Sqrt processor to
            compute the result

            \item The \texttt{sqrt} result just computed should be stored in
            the RAM at the same address that was just read

        \end{itemize}

        \item The hardware design should use 115200 baud rate and require NO
        modification to compile

        \item The design must include a simulation of the top-level design and
        discuss it in the report with a parameter to control baud rate. It is
        strongly recommended to consider modify the baud rate for the purpose
        of top-level simulation -- this should be controlled by a SINGLE
        parameter set in the test- bench. The design should not modify the UART
        implementation files.

        \item The FSM controller must as much as possible rely on use of status
        and control signals to manage the datapath timing, the design should
        not rely on "fixed" waits. This represents a better abstraction.

        \end{itemize}

    \section{Design Approach} The source code for interfacing with UART was
    provided. The controller FSM was implemented to provide all the glue logic
    required to interface the UART with the \texttt{sqrt} module and the block
    RAM. The multiplexer controlling the \texttt{tx\_data} in the datapath is
    integrated into the controller module as the states \texttt{ramhi} and
    \texttt{ramlo}. Figure \ref{fig:block} provides the top-level block diagram
    of the project implementation.

        \begin{figure}[ht]
            \begin{center}
                \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{block_diagram.png}
                \caption{Block Diagram of the Implementation}
                \label{fig:block}
            \end{center}
        \end{figure}

        \subsection{Controller FSM} The controller FSM consists of 7 states
        visualized in Figure \ref{fig:states}.

            \begin{figure}[ht]
                \begin{center}
                    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{state_diagram.png}
                    \caption{State Diagram of the Implementation of the
                    Controller}
                    \label{fig:states}
                \end{center}
            \end{figure}

            \subsubsection{addrhi} This is the initial state of the controller
            to detect when the high bytes of the RAM block address from
            \texttt{rx\_data} have been transferred from the UART. The state
            proceeds to \texttt{addrlo} when the shifter at \texttt{rx} is
            empty and \texttt{AH} is ready.

            \subsubsection{addrlo} Activated when the shifter at \texttt{rx} is
            empty and \texttt{AH} is ready. This is the second state of the
            controller to detect when the low bytes of the RAM block address
            from \texttt{rx\_data} have been transferred from the UART. The
            state saves the entire 12-bit address of the RAM block and then
            proceeds to \texttt{datahi} when the shifter at \texttt{rx} is
            empty and \texttt{AL} is ready.

            \subsubsection{datahi} Activated when the shifter at \texttt{rx} is
            empty and \texttt{AL} is ready. This is the third state of the
            controller to detect when the high bytes of the RAM block input
            data from \texttt{rx\_data} have been transferred from the UART.
            The state proceeds to \texttt{datahi} when the shifter at
            \texttt{rx} is empty and \texttt{DH} is ready.

            \subsubsection{datalo} Activated when the shifter at \texttt{rx} is
            empty and \texttt{DH} is ready. This is the fourth state of the
            controller to detect when the low bytes of the RAM block input data
            from \texttt{rx\_data} have been transferred from the UART. The
            state sends the entire 16-bit data to the \texttt{sqrt} module and
            then proceeds to \texttt{ramwr} when the shifter at \texttt{rx} is
            empty and \texttt{DL} is ready.

            \subsubsection{ramwr} Activated when the \texttt{sqrt} module is
            and \texttt{DL} is ready. This is the fifth state of the controller
            to write to the RAM block. The state sends the entire 12-bit
            address and the output of the \texttt{sqrt} module to the RAM block
            and then proceeds to \texttt{ramhi}.

            \subsubsection{ramhi} Activated when the shifter at \texttt{tx} is
            empty and data read from the RAM block is valid and ready. This is
            the sixth state of the controller to read from the RAM block with
            the same address and passed back to the UART. The state sends the
            high 8-bit data read from the \texttt{sqrt} module to the
            \texttt{tx\_data} in the UART.

            \subsubsection{ramlo} Activated when the shifter at \texttt{tx} is
            empty and data read from the RAM block is valid and ready. This is
            the final state of the controller to read from the RAM block with
            the same address and passed back to the UART. The state sends the
            low 8-bit data read from the \texttt{sqrt} module to the
            \texttt{tx\_data} in the UART.

    \section{Testing} The project submission includes test benches for the
    controller as well as the top-level module integrating all the modules.
    Figure \ref{fig:tbwav} shows an example use of the implementation with the
    memory file contents: 01, 01, 00, 04.

    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{controller_tb_wav.png}
            \caption{Sample Testbench Waveform of the Controller Module}
            \label{fig:tbwav}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    Figure \ref{fig:tbwav} demonstrates the unit after its final state. The
    address to the RAM block was passed as 0001 0000 0001 (low 4 bits of the
    high 01 hex value and the entire low 01 hex value). The data passed to the
    \texttt{sqrt} module was 0000 0000 0000 0100 (00 and 04). The \texttt{sqrt}
    module returns 0000 0010 ($\sqrt{\text{4}}=\text{2}$).
