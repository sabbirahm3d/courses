\section{Part 1}
    An oceanographer wants to test, on the basis of a random sample of size 35, whether the average depth of the ocean in a certain area is 72.4 fathoms. At the 0.05 level of significance, what will the oceanographer decide if she gets a sample mean of 73.2? Assume the population standard deviation is 2.1.\n
    % Given

    %     \[ n = 35 \]
    %     \[ \mu = 72.4 \]
    %     \[ \sigma = 2.1 \]

    The null hypothesis, $H_{0}$, claims the mean depth of the ocean in a certain area is 72.4, while the alternative hypothesis, $H_{a}$ says otherwise.

        \[ H_{0}: \mu = 72.4 \ vs \ H_{a}: \mu = 73.2 \]
