\section{Introduction}
This report serves as the writing and documenting portion of the three-part Reciprocal Motor-Generator Project. The components consisted of:

    \begin{itemize}

        \item Construction of the motor-generator set

        \item Description of the motor-generator set

        \item Evaluation of others' motor-generator sets

    \end{itemize}

    \noindent
    By definition, an electric generator is an electrical machine that converts electrical current into mechanical energy. An electric generator is the inverse of an electric generator, as it converts mechanical energy into electrical current.
