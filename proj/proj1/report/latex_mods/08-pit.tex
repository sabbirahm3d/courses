\section{ProgrammableÂ Interval Timer - 8254}
An 8254 programmable interval timer chip is integrated into the system. The component is required to solve the common timing control problems in the microprocessor. The chip also facilitates in other aspects of the system, such as accurate time delays, real time clocks, event counters, square wave generation, etc. The 8254 has 3 independent 16-bit programmable counters, each capable of counting in binary or binary coded decimal (BCD) with a maximum frequency of 1 MHz.
