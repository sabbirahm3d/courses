    \documentinfo{\textbf{Homework 5: Snake Levels and Obstacles | Preliminary
    Design}}{\today}{Sabbir Ahmed}
    \vspace{-0.1in}

    \section{Background} For this assignment, a modification of the previously
    implemented snake game with levels and obstacles will be implemented.

    \section{Design Approach} Most of the modules from the previous version of
    the game will be used in the implementation. Additional modules to handle
    the LCD driver and high-level game state machine will be included. The
    state machine will consist of 100 states representing the 100 levels in the
    game. Each states will increment only if the size of the snake body exceeds
    5.
