    "#### What are dummy variables?\n",
    "Dummy variables are a set of variables that takes the value 0 or 1 to indicate the presence or absence of each category in a catergorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why do we need dummy variables?\n",
    "Most machine learning techniques will only accept numberical values as inputs as will not accept string objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, most machine learning techniques will not accept the variable `state = ['DC', 'VA', 'MD']` but will understand the corresponding dummy variables `state_DC = [0, 1]`, `state_VA = [0, 1]`, and `state_MD = [0, 1]`, where `0` indicates absence of that category and `1` indicates presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "| state | state_DC | state_VA | state_MD |\n",
    "|-------|----------|----------|----------|\n",
    "| DC    | 1        | 0        | 0        |\n",
    "| VA    | 0        | 1        | 0        |\n",
    "| MD    | 0        | 0        | 1        |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why are numerical values sometimes converted to dummy variables?\n",
    "If a variable takes on numerical values, but the values themselves do not imply an order, then they can be treated as categorical values and converted to dummy variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a variable which holds internet socket port numbers used in network communications and can take on values form the list `ports = [20, 22, 25, 80]`. Port 20 is typically used for FTP traffic and port 80 is typically used for web traffic. There is no implied meaning that port 80 is 4 times as much as port 20. Here it is better to treat ports as a categorical variable and used dummy variables. Read more about port numbers [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is there an easy way to create dummy variables?\n",
    "Yes, pandas `pd.get_dummies()` makes it really easy to make dummy variables. Read the API docs for the function [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html)."
