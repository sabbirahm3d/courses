# My Courses
Course content of a typical computer engineering student at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Courses where instructors explicitly requested the privacy of the material are not included in this repository.<br>

Courses that are set as private submodules are courses I am currently enrolled in and will not be made public until the end of the semester. CMPE 323: Signals and Systems is made temporarily private upon the instructor's request.<br>

NOTE: These are obviously not the only classes required by the curriculum. Only courses with version controllable content and/or relevant topics are included.
