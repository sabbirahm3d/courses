# My Courses
Course content of a typical computer engineering student at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Courses where instructors explicitly requested the privacy of the material are not included in this repository.<br>

Courses that are set as submodules are currently being taken by me and will not be public until the end of the semester.<br>

NOTE: These are obviously not the only classes required by the curriculum. Only courses with version controllable content and/or relevant topics are included.
