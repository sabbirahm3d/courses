DS | Unit Project 4

### PROMPT

In this project, you will combine and apply your knowledge from all three past unit projects to create a complete data science workflow on a new dataset. We will use the Kaggle Titanic competition dataset for this project.

**Goal:** Completed Ipython Notebook and submission file for Kaggle (or Kaggle score)

---

### DELIVERABLES

#### iPython Notebook with Executive Summary

- **Requirements:**
    - Completed Parts 1 through 5
    - Submission file or Kaggle score

- **Bonus:**
    - Always consider your audience - what do they already know vs. what should you define or explain?
    - What additional features, metrics, or summary plots were you able to make?

- **Submission:**
    - Submit completed ipynb file using Slack DM to instructor

### TIMELINE

| Deadline | Deliverable| Description |
|:-:|---|---|
| Lesson 11 | Project 4  | Notebook with Executive Summary   |

---

### EVALUATION

Your project will be assessed using the following standards:

1. Present Results
2. Professional Development

#### Rubric: [Click here for the complete rubric](./project4-rubric.md).

Requirements for these standards will be assessed using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

While your total score may serve as a helpful gauge of whether you've met project goals, __specific standards scores are more important__ since they can show you where to focus your efforts in the future!

### RESOURCES

#### Dataset  
We'll be using the Kaggle Titanic dataset for this project. You can find details about the competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). You will need to make a Kaggle account to make a submission.

```
VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:
survival        Survival
                (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
pclass          Passenger Class
                (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
name            Name
sex             Sex
age             Age
sibsp           Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
parch           Number of Parents/Children Aboard
ticket          Ticket Number
fare            Passenger Fare
cabin           Cabin
embarked        Port of Embarkation
                (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

SPECIAL NOTES:
Pclass is a proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
 1st ~ Upper; 2nd ~ Middle; 3rd ~ Lower

Age is in Years; Fractional if Age less than One (1)
 If the Age is Estimated, it is in the form xx.5

With respect to the family relation variables (i.e. sibsp and parch)
some relations were ignored.  The following are the definitions used
for sibsp and parch.

Sibling:  Brother, Sister, Stepbrother, or Stepsister of Passenger Aboard Titanic
Spouse:   Husband or Wife of Passenger Aboard Titanic (Mistresses and Fiances Ignored)
Parent:   Mother or Father of Passenger Aboard Titanic
Child:    Son, Daughter, Stepson, or Stepdaughter of Passenger Aboard Titanic

Other family relatives excluded from this study include cousins,
nephews/nieces, aunts/uncles, and in-laws.  Some children travelled
only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.  As well, some
travelled with very close friends or neighbors in a village, however,
the definitions do not support such relations.
```

Dataset: The train.csv and test.csv are already downloaded and available for you in the `/assets/datasets/titanic/` folder for this project.

#### Starter code
Open the [iPython Notebook](./starter-code/project4-starter.ipynb) and follow the questions provided.

#### Suggestions for Getting Started

- Review your previous work and any prior instructor feedback.
- Look up sample executive summaries online.
- Look up blog posts on the Kaggle Titanic challenge.
