    \section{Background}
    Consider the following 3-input,2-output truth table:

    \begin{table}[h]

        \begin{tabular*}{100pt}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}} ccc|c|c}

            \textbf{a} & \textbf{b} & \textbf{c} & \textbf{y} & \textbf{z} \\
            \hline
            1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
            1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
            1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
            \multicolumn{3}{c|}{otherwise} & 0 & 1 \\
        \end{tabular*}
    \end{table}

    where - denotes donâ€™t care

    Implement the table as a module using the following variations. Synthesize each version and submit a screen-capture of the RTL view.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
        \item using behavioral code with if statements
        \item using concurrent continuous assignment statement(s)
        \item using behavioral code with case statements
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Implementation}
        \subsection{Using Behavioral Code With `If' Statements}
        The module implementation along with its testbench can be found in the `scripts' directory. A sample of the waveform generated is provided:

        \begin{figure}[ht]
            \begin{center}
                \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{version_a_wav.png}
                \caption{Waveform Generated from Part 1 Version A Test Bench} \label{fig:a_wav}
            \end{center}
        \end{figure}

        The module was synthesized and its RTL view was generated:
        \begin{figure}[ht]
            \begin{center}
                \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{version_a.png}
                \caption{RTL View of Part 1 Version A} \label{fig:a_rtl}
            \end{center}
        \end{figure}

        \subsection{Using Concurrent Continuous Assignment Statement(s)}
        The module implementation along with its testbench can be found in the `scripts' directory. A sample of the waveform generated is provided:

        \begin{figure}[ht]
            \begin{center}
                \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{version_b_wav.png}
                \caption{Waveform Generated from Part 1 Version B Test Bench} \label{fig:b_wav}
            \end{center}
        \end{figure}

        The module was synthesized and its RTL view was generated:
        \begin{figure}[ht]
            \begin{center}
                \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{version_b.png}
                \caption{RTL View of Part 1 Version B} \label{fig:b_rtl}
            \end{center}
        \end{figure}


        \subsection{Using Behavioral Code With Case Statements}
        The module implementation along with its testbench can be found in the `scripts' directory. A sample of the waveform generated is provided:

        \begin{figure}[ht]
            \begin{center}
                \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{version_c_wav.png}
                \caption{Waveform Generated from Part 1 Version C Test Bench} \label{fig:c_wav}
            \end{center}
        \end{figure}

        The module was synthesized and its RTL view was generated:
        \begin{figure}[ht]
            \begin{center}
                \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{version_c.png}
                \caption{RTL View of Part 1 Version C} \label{fig:c_rtl}
            \end{center}
        \end{figure}

    \section{Observations}
    The Register Transfer Level of Version B appears to have the simplest harware implementation due to its minimized equations. However, using concurrent continuous assignemnt statements do not allow any explicit `don't care' assignments.
