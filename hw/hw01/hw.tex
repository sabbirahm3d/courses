    \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*}]

        \item Compare and contrast microkernel and monolithic kernel-based
        operating systems. Name one kernel that follows each of these models.
        \item[\textbf{Ans}]
        A microkernel implements user and kernel services in different address
        spaces, whereas a monolithic kernel system uses the same address space.
        This separation makes microkernels easily extendable with new services
        being added to its user space. The monolithic kernel requires the
        entire kernel to be rebuilt after adding new services. Since only the
        kernel services are located in its address spaces, the microkernels are
        comparatively smaller than a monolithic kernel. Also, if a service
        fails in a microkernel, the operating system remains unaffected.
        Monolithic kernels, however, execute faster as they use system calls to
        communicate between application and hardware. Microkernels rely on the
        relatively slower message passing to communicate. Performance of
        microkernels are also affected by increased system-function overhead.
        Monolithic kernels also require lesser code in their design than
        microkernels.

        \item What is the purpose of a system call? Give at least 3 concrete
        examples of potential system calls in an OS and explain why each would
        be a system call.
        \item[\textbf{Ans}]
        \vspace{0.2in}

        \item Describe what a context switch is. How does context switching
        differ between processes and between threads within a single process?
        \item[\textbf{Ans}]
        \vspace{0.2in}

        \item Name two methods of IPC (interprocess communication) and discuss
        the pros and cons of each.
        \item[\textbf{Ans}]
            The two fundamental models of interprocess communication are shared
            memory and message passing.
        \vspace{0.2in}

        \item What is the difference between a program being executed by a
        single thread and one that is being executed by multiple threads?
        Compare and contrast task parallelism and data parallelism as it
        relates to multithreaded programs.
        \item[\textbf{Ans}]
