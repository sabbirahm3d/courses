\section{Introduction}
This document provides detailed instructions to develop an 8086 microprocessor board using Cadence\textregistered \ OrCAD\textregistered \ Capture software. Included are the schematics of individual IC components and their description. Details of the ICs include decoding, programming specifications, and descriptions of IC pinouts.

    \subsection{Purpose}
    As per the project description, this document is to serve as the only documentation of the operational and functional specifications of the Intel 8086. The documentation is to be thorough and concise to provide information to design a similar board.

    \subsection{Scope and Organization of Document}
    This report will elaborate on the integrated circuit (IC) chips used in designing the board, along with brief high level overviews of their pinouts, the different connections
