    \section{Background} In this project students will learn to use generated
    IP Cores: a block RAM and a CORDIC processor for calculating square root.
    An essential skill to develop is the coding of a control finite state
    machine (FSM) to interface modules.

        \subsection{Requirements}

        \begin{itemize}

        \item The design should access 4 bytes from the serial port to initiate
        action

        \item The implementation should assume 4 bytes will be sent: ADDRESS-
        HIGH, ADDRESS-LOW, DATA-HIGH, DATA-LOW

        \item After 4 bytes are received the design should

        \begin{itemize}

            \item Read the contents of the RAM and send the HIGH-BYTE, then
            LOW-BYTE back through the UART

            \item Send the data bytes through the CORDIC Sqrt processor to
            compute the result

            \item The \texttt{sqrt} result just computed should be stored in
            the RAM at the same address that was just read

        \end{itemize}

        \item The hardware design should use 115200 baud rate and require NO
        modification to compile

        \item The design must include a simulation of the top-level design and
        discuss it in the report with a parameter to control baud rate. It is
        strongly recommended to consider modify the baud rate for the purpose
        of top-level simulation -- this should be controlled by a SINGLE
        parameter set in the test- bench. The design should not modify the UART
        implementation files.

        \item The FSM controller must as much as possible rely on use of status
        and control signals to manage the datapath timing, the design should
        not rely on "fixed" waits. This represents a better abstraction.

        \end{itemize}

    \section{Design Approach} The source code for interfacing with UART was
    provided. The controller FSM was implemented in 7 states visualized in
    Figure \ref{fig:states}. The module provides all the glue logic required to
    interface the UART with the \texttt{sqrt} module and the block RAM.
