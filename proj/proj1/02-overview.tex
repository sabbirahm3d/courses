    \subsection{Features}
    The 8086 microprocessor is known for its significant advancements since its predecessors. The most prominent features include, but are not limited to:

    \begin{itemize}

        \item 6 bytes of cache memory for faster processing

        \item Pipelining stages: Fetch Stage and Execute Stage

        \item Instruction queue

        \item 256 vectored interrupts

        \item Maximum and minimum modes of operation, suitable for multiple and single processors respectively

    \end{itemize}
