\section{LEDs and DIP Switches}
2 common-anode seven-segment LEDs with a decimal point segment, 8 standalone LEDs and 8 DIP switches are also connected to and integrated into the system. 

    \subsection{Seven-Segment LEDs}
    74LS374 latches decoded at 0x00CE and 0x00CF are used to interface the 7-segment LEDs.

    \subsection{LEDs}
    A 74LS374 latch decoded at 0x00CC is used to interface the 7-segment LEDs.

    \subsection{DIP Switches}
    A 74LS244 buffer decoded at 0x00CA is used to interface the 8 DIP switches.
