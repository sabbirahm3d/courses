    \begin{enumerate}

        \item Describe the functions of the Memory Management Unit in a modern
        computer system.

        \item What is a virtual address space? Why do we use virtual address
        spaces in modern operating systems?

        \item Compare and contrast the use of paging and segmentation for
        memory management in an OS.

        \item Consider a logical address space of 64 pages of 1024 words each,
        mapped onto a physical memory of 32 frames of 1024 words each. How many
        bits are required to represent a logical address (assuming word-based
        addressing).

        \item With the same address space layout as the previous question, how
        many bits are required to represent a physical address (once again,
        assuming word-based addressing).

    \end{enumerate}
