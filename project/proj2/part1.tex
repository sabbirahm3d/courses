\subsection{Output}

    The first sample mean and standard deviation were computed:

    \[ E(\overline{X}) = 3.110, \ \sigma_{\overline{X}} = 0.316 \]

    All the samples were then used to find the sample mean and standard
    deviation. The theoretical values were also computed based on the
    relationships:

    \[ \mu = \mu \]
    \[ E(\overline{X}) = \mu \]
    \[ \sigma = \sigma \]
    \[ \sigma_{\overline{X}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \]
